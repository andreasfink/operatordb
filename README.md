# Operatordb #

This is a very simple library to get from IMSI to mobile operator information. The source is generated out of a database of mobile operators and is organized in a digit tree for high speed translation.

There is only one C function *get_operator_from_imsi* doing all the work.


	./configure

	make

	make install

will build it normally

if you want to modify the database and regenerate it, do the following:

1. create a mysqldb and import the ts25.sql database in it
2. copy dp.php-example to db.php and edit it accordingly
3. type:
    
	make generate

	make
    
	make install

this will regenerate the operatordb.c out of the database and recompile it.
